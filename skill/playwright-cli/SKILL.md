# Playwright CLI Browser Automation

Use this skill when frontend work requires executable browser automation, interactive page inspection, Playwright-oriented debugging, snapshots, traces, or browser-generated evidence.

## Relationship with `$web-ui-ux`

- Use `$web-ui-ux` to decide **what** should change in the UI and how to evaluate visual/UX quality.
- Use `$playwright-cli` to execute browser flows, inspect the page state, capture evidence, and debug UI behavior.
- For Angular or other web UI work, these two skills are complementary rather than interchangeable.

## Scope

Apply this skill when the task requires:

- opening and navigating real pages in a browser session
- capturing snapshots, screenshots, traces, or videos as evidence
- debugging Playwright tests or reproducing flaky UI behavior
- generating Playwright TypeScript interaction code from manual browser exploration
- mocking network requests or manipulating browser storage/session state

Do not use this skill as a replacement for stack-specific test commands or higher-level visual design guidance.

## Quick Start

```bash
# open new browser
playwright-cli open
# navigate to a page
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli type "page.click"
playwright-cli press Enter
# take a screenshot (rarely used, as snapshot is more common)
playwright-cli screenshot
# close the browser
playwright-cli close
```

## Core Commands

```bash
playwright-cli open
playwright-cli open https://example.com/
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
playwright-cli type "search query"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli dblclick e7
playwright-cli fill e5 "user@example.com" --submit
playwright-cli drag e2 e8
playwright-cli drop e4 --path=./image.png
playwright-cli drop e4 --data="text/plain=hello world"
playwright-cli hover e4
playwright-cli select e9 "option-value"
playwright-cli upload ./document.pdf
playwright-cli check e12
playwright-cli uncheck e12
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli eval "document.title"
playwright-cli eval "el => el.textContent" e5
playwright-cli eval "el => el.id" e5
playwright-cli eval "el => el.getAttribute('data-testid')" e5
playwright-cli dialog-accept
playwright-cli dialog-accept "confirmation text"
playwright-cli dialog-dismiss
playwright-cli resize 1920 1080
playwright-cli close
```

## Navigation

```bash
playwright-cli go-back
playwright-cli go-forward
playwright-cli reload
```

## Keyboard and Mouse

```bash
playwright-cli press Enter
playwright-cli press ArrowDown
playwright-cli keydown Shift
playwright-cli keyup Shift

playwright-cli mousemove 150 300
playwright-cli mousedown
playwright-cli mousedown right
playwright-cli mouseup
playwright-cli mouseup right
playwright-cli mousewheel 0 100
```

## Save as

```bash
playwright-cli screenshot
playwright-cli screenshot e5
playwright-cli screenshot --filename=page.png
playwright-cli pdf --filename=page.pdf
```

## Tabs

```bash
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-new
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/page
playwright-cli tab-close
playwright-cli tab-close 2
playwright-cli tab-select 0
```

## Storage and Network

```bash
playwright-cli state-save
playwright-cli state-save auth.json
playwright-cli state-load auth.json
playwright-cli cookie-list
playwright-cli cookie-get session_id
playwright-cli cookie-set session_id abc123
playwright-cli cookie-delete session_id
playwright-cli cookie-clear
playwright-cli localstorage-list
playwright-cli localstorage-get theme
playwright-cli localstorage-set theme dark
playwright-cli localstorage-delete theme
playwright-cli localstorage-clear
playwright-cli sessionstorage-list
playwright-cli sessionstorage-get step
playwright-cli sessionstorage-set step 3
playwright-cli sessionstorage-delete step
playwright-cli sessionstorage-clear
playwright-cli route "**/*.jpg" --status=404
playwright-cli route "https://api.example.com/**" --body='{"mock": true}'
playwright-cli route-list
playwright-cli unroute "**/*.jpg"
playwright-cli unroute
```

## DevTools and Evidence

```bash
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli console warning
playwright-cli network
playwright-cli run-code "async page => await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation'])"
playwright-cli run-code --filename=script.js
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli video-start video.webm
playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000
playwright-cli video-stop
playwright-cli show --annotate
playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw
playwright-cli highlight e5
playwright-cli highlight e5 --style="outline: 3px dashed red"
playwright-cli highlight e5 --hide
playwright-cli highlight --hide
```

## Raw Output

Use `--raw` when you want only the return value without surrounding metadata.

```bash
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)"
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
playwright-cli click e5
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id
playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

Use `--json` when structured output is required.

```bash
playwright-cli list --json
```

## Targeting Elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with elements.

```bash
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
playwright-cli -s=mysession close
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data
playwright-cli list
playwright-cli close-all
playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Installation

If the global command is unavailable, try a local invocation first:

```bash
npx --no-install playwright-cli --version
```

If needed, install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## Example Workflows

### Form submission

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

### Multi-tab workflow

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

### Debugging with DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli network
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

### Interactive session

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli show --annotate
```
